The most confusing part was trying to add a new visual effect without breaking the original animation. 
It was incredibly hard to get the timing right, and the codes kept interfering or running too soon.

The animation vividly shows that tasks don't all happen at once. We see the "loading" frames ticking by,
then a clear pause, and then the "Done!" message appears. Actions complete over time rather than instantly.

I added a new feature that makes the page auto-refresh a few seconds after the "Done!" message appears. 
This signaled that the process was actually finished and ready for the next step without clashing with
the original visual loading sequence.
